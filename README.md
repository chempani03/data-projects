# Data-Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am passionate about data science and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and skills in this field. Here, you will find a collection of projects I have undertaken for personal enrichment as well as those completed for school assignments. Through these projects, I aim to showcase my understanding of various data science concepts, methodologies, and tools. Whether it's exploring datasets, analyzing trends, building predictive models, or visualizing insights, I am always excited to embark on new data-driven challenges. Feel free to explore my work!

My bachelors in data science commenced March 2022, as of now, not only have i learned multiple topics regarding my field and more, I also have taken extra curricular courses to further develop my knowledge and hope to show my progression on this rep.
